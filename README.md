LM_GaBP
=======
It is the implementation of solving matrix equation using Gaussian belief propagation. The algorithm is from the [paper](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/pubs/bickson-ISIT1.pdf). To run program, Python 2.7 is needed and some of its library are [Networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/).

Running the code

```python
python main.py A.txt b.txt
```
